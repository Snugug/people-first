  <dd>Modeled on the German <em>Einfühlung</em>; from <em>ein</em> "in" + <em>Fühlung</em> "feeling". Coined in 1858 by the German philosopher Rudolf Lotze as a translation of the Greek <em>empatheia</em> or "passion, state of emotion"; an assimilated form of <em>en</em> "in" and <em>pathos</em> "feeling". From a theory of art appreciation that maintains appreciation depends on the viewer's ability to project his personality into the viewed object.</dd>
